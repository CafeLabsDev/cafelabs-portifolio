## About the project

This repository is the institutional website for **Café Labs**, published at
[cafelabs.net](https://cafelabs.net). It's the company's landing page (not a
specific product's): it presents Café Labs' manifesto/methodology ("Test.
Build. Validate.") and lists every product in the ecosystem (Domo, Dindin,
Forge Skill Library, mind) as cards in a bento grid, in the "O Laboratório"
block, each one linking to that product's own landing/site.

For anyone who wants to understand the business behind the code, see
[docs/ARQUITETURA.md](docs/ARQUITETURA.md) for the technical structure.

## Documentation

- [docs/ARQUITETURA.md](docs/ARQUITETURA.md) — page/component structure, how the bento grid works, and how to add a new product.
- [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) — visual identity: palette, typography, tokens.
- [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md) — Vercel deploy, domain.
- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) — notes for anyone using an AI agent in this repo.

This project has no backend of its own — it's a static/SSR site with no data
persistence (the "products" listed in the bento grid are external links to
their own repos/deploys).
